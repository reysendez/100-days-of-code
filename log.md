# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 12,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML Survey Form project on FreeCode Camp and installed Git on Oracle VM VirtualBox.

**Thoughts:** I'm not very new to HTML but I struggled with understanding how to install Git and use the Bash terminal.

### Day 2: March 13,2024 

**Today's Progress**: Learn CSS Box Model and Flexbox through FreeCodeCamp projects of the "Rothko painting" and "Photo Gallery".

**Thoughts**: These are simply refreshers on CSS I've done before but taking the time to read and understand each piece of code instead of rushing has really solidified my understanding of what margin, padding and display properties are.

### Day 3: March 14,2024

**Today's Progress**: Delved deeper into using Git, getting familiar with cloning repositories and using the Bash terminal more often. Completed the HTML section for The Odin Project.

**Thoughts**: Using Bash instead of the UI to move folders and files has been good practice for me. I was already familair with HTML beforehand so I breezed through that section in Foundations.

### Day 4: March 15,2024

**Today's Progress**: Delved deeper into using Git, getting familiar with cloning repositories and using the Bash terminal more often. Completed the HTML section for The Odin Project and first 5 Foundations exercises.

**Thoughts**: The assignments were easy to do once I've read the README.md and looked at the desired results, had no trouble getting it done without the solutions.

### Day 5: March 16,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed The Cascade, learned Chrome DevTools basics and solved the final Foundations exercise.

**Thoughts**: I struggled to center an image on the original odin-recipes project I did but once I searched for a solution online, I was able to implement it with little trouble.
