# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 12,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML Survey Form project on FreeCode Camp and installed Git on Oracle VM VirtualBox.

**Thoughts:** I'm not very new to HTML but I struggled with understanding how to install Git and use the Bash terminal.

### Day 2: March 13,2024 

**Today's Progress**: Learn CSS Box Model and Flexbox through FreeCodeCamp projects of the "Rothko painting" and "Photo Gallery".

**Thoughts**: These are simply refreshers on CSS I've done before but taking the time to read and understand each piece of code instead of rushing has really solidified my understanding of what margin, padding and display properties are.

### Day 3: March 14,2024

**Today's Progress**: Delved deeper into using Git, getting familiar with cloning repositories and using the Bash terminal more often. Completed the HTML section for The Odin Project.

**Thoughts**: Using Bash instead of the UI to move folders and files has been good practice for me. I was already familair with HTML beforehand so I breezed through that section in Foundations.

### Day 4: March 15,2024

**Today's Progress**: Delved deeper into using Git, getting familiar with cloning repositories and using the Bash terminal more often. Completed the HTML section for The Odin Project and first 5 Foundations exercises.

**Thoughts**: The assignments were easy to do once I've read the README.md and looked at the desired results, had no trouble getting it done without the solutions.

### Day 5: March 16,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed The Cascade, learned Chrome DevTools basics and solved the final Foundations exercise.

**Thoughts**: I struggled to center an image on the original odin-recipes project I did but once I searched for a solution online, I was able to implement it with little trouble.

### Day 6: March 17,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Block and Inline module on TOP, halfway through the learn accessibility quiz project on FCC and updated odin-recipes project with cleaner navigation and button links on all individual recipe pages.

**Thoughts**: I'm having some trouble with centering objects on a page but I think using divs around content that I want to center using margin seems to be the best method. I'm also getting used to specifying selectors to make sure some properties don't conflict with what I want. Accessibiity is a big priority of mine so I'm taking my time getting through the quiz project I'm building because I want to understand it better.

### Day 7: March 18,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learn Accessibility quiz project on FCC and learned CSS Flexbox properties on TOP, read documentation on flex, justify-content and align-items.

**Thoughts**: Flexbox is quite a learning curve but I definitely understood after read MDN docs and watching Kevin Powell's YouTube video on Flexbox model. With some practice, I know I'll understand the ins and outs.
