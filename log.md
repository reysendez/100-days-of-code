# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 12,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML Survey Form project on FreeCode Camp and installed Git on Oracle VM VirtualBox.

**Thoughts:** I'm not very new to HTML but I struggled with understanding how to install Git and use the Bash terminal.

### Day 2: March 13,2024 

**Today's Progress**: Learn CSS Box Model and Flexbox through FreeCodeCamp projects of the "Rothko painting" and "Photo Gallery".

**Thoughts**: These are simply refreshers on CSS I've done before but taking the time to read and understand each piece of code instead of rushing has really solidified my understanding of what margin, padding and display properties are.

### Day 3: March 14,2024

**Today's Progress**: Delved deeper into using Git, getting familiar with cloning repositories and using the Bash terminal more often. Completed the HTML section for The Odin Project.

**Thoughts**: Using Bash instead of the UI to move folders and files has been good practice for me. I was already familair with HTML beforehand so I breezed through that section in Foundations.

### Day 4: March 15,2024

**Today's Progress**: Delved deeper into using Git, getting familiar with cloning repositories and using the Bash terminal more often. Completed the HTML section for The Odin Project and first 5 Foundations exercises.

**Thoughts**: The assignments were easy to do once I've read the README.md and looked at the desired results, had no trouble getting it done without the solutions.

### Day 5: March 16,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed The Cascade, learned Chrome DevTools basics and solved the final Foundations exercise.

**Thoughts**: I struggled to center an image on the original odin-recipes project I did but once I searched for a solution online, I was able to implement it with little trouble.

### Day 6: March 17,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Block and Inline module on TOP, halfway through the learn accessibility quiz project on FCC and updated odin-recipes project with cleaner navigation and button links on all individual recipe pages.

**Thoughts**: I'm having some trouble with centering objects on a page but I think using divs around content that I want to center using margin seems to be the best method. I'm also getting used to specifying selectors to make sure some properties don't conflict with what I want. Accessibiity is a big priority of mine so I'm taking my time getting through the quiz project I'm building because I want to understand it better.

### Day 7: March 18,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learn Accessibility quiz project on FCC and learned CSS Flexbox properties on TOP, read documentation on flex, justify-content and align-items.

**Thoughts**: Flexbox is quite a learning curve but I definitely understood after read MDN docs and watching Kevin Powell's YouTube video on Flexbox model. With some practice, I know I'll understand the ins and outs.

### Day 8: March 19,2024

**Today's Progress**: Read Alignments module on TOP and started Learn HTML course on Codeacademy.

**Thoughts**: Lots of reading on Flexbox, I definitely understand align-items and justify-content more with the interactive tutorials but flex shorthand properties, main-axis and cross-axis are still taking some time to sink in my brain.

### Day 10: March 20,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed flex folder in css-exercises from TOP.

**Thoughts**: Flexbox exercises were simple in the beginning  but I started to struggled with exercises 5-7, had to get some hints from the solutions folder to help me along. I'm definitely going to have to go back and re-read the documentation and take physical notes on difficult web development concepts.

### Day 11: March 21,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed flex fold in css-exercises a second time and completed all 24 levels of Flexbox Froggy.

**Thoughts**: Doing the exercises again, I had an easier time doing them once I re-read all the assigned readings and some supplemental resources on TOP. I only peeked at the solutions for 1 exercise but that's a big step for me! I also tapped into the Flexbox Froggy game to enrich my understanding of Flexbox, I'm a little more confident now to take on the Flexbox project tomorrow.

### Day 12: March 22,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Landing Page project on TOP using CSS Flexbox.

**Thoughts**: I struggled a little getting things to sit right once I started incorporating Flexbox. I had no issues visualing the desired outcome into containers and boxes, starting with only writing the HTML structure of the layout and then working from the header all the way down to the footer helped so much. I have to tackle this project (and future ones!) one container at a time and I think I will fare just fine!

### Day 13: March 23,2024

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded and deployed the Landing Page project to Github, moved on to learning Javascript basics.

**Thoughts**: I was super proud of myself for getting that project done from scratch. Now I am learning basic Javascript, which is a quite a refresher as I took a course on it on Codecademy. I remember quite a few things but not the syntax but my memory is coming back.

### Day 14: March 24,2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Variables and Operators module on TOP.

**Thoughts**: As I mentioned yesterday, I remember some of this from a course I took on Codecademy even though I never finished. I learned how to put a script inside the <body> tag element on a HTML file and how to operate the console when I open the Live Server. Most of today has been reading different documentation and doing little exercises to reinforce what I learned. Lots of potential with using Javascript to further enhance my websites now that I have HTML and CSS Flexbox in my toolkit.

### Day 15: March 25,2024

**Today's Progress**: Made my way halfway through Data Types and Conditionals on TOP.

**Thoughts**: Lots of reading to get through again, did a little experimentation along with the tutorials but not much coding involved yet. Will be doing the Replit exercises tomorrow!

### Day 16: March 26,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Data Types and Conditionals module on TOP, finished all 4 Replit exercises.

**Thoughts**: Exercises were easy to do, the module was very reading intensive with all the Javascript resources given.

### Day 17: March 27,2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Javascript Developer Tools module on TOP.

**Thoughts**: Since I am back at work, progress on learning has been getting slower. While I did read the resources and followed along with some of the tutorials, I somehow had a hard time recreating the debugging tutorial Chrome DevTools had. Huh. I guess I'll have to go back and try again tomorrow just to make sure I didn't miss anything about it before moving forward to learn more about Javascript.

### Day 18: March 31,2024

**Today's Progress**: Started CSS Pseudo Selectors project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Missed 3 days of this 100 Days of Code challenge. Work has been draining me like crazy, definitely going to have to use the downtime to get this challenge going still.

### Day 19: April 1st,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Function Basics module on TOP.

**Thoughts**: I'm understanding the function syntax for Javascript but I need to go ahead and try to save documentation for many Javascript methods that will come in handy when I start writing functions for different tasks.

### Day 20: April 2nd,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Problem Solving module on TOP.

**Thoughts**: These assignment resources I read over are the things I needed when I first attempted Computer Science in college when I was there. I understand the problem solving process through tackling one subproblem at a time to conquer the main problem I am solving.

### Day 21: April 3rd,2024

**Today's Progress**: Started Rock, Papers, Scissor game project on TOP.

**Thoughts**: It was easy to start writing if/else statements for the CPU player but once I started to get to writing a loop for a 5-round game, that's when things fell apart. I'm going to come back to this project tomorrow with fresh eyes.

### Day 22: April 4th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Rock, Papers, Scissor game project on TOP with Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Made the do/while loop to solve my issue of being a 5 round game as well as keeping track of the score for all 5 rounds and giving a different response each round, which let me know it worked as intended!

### Day 23: April 8th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Clean Code and Installing Node.js modules on TOP.

**Thoughts**: Did mostly reading today about best coding practices, which was a nice change of pace. I managed to install Node.js into my terminal which means I can use it to compile any JavaScript code I input in bash.

### Day 24: April 9th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting on freeCodeCamp, started reading Arrays and Loops module on TOP.

**Thoughts**: Learned quite a bit about more properties on CSS, what they do and how to use them. I now understand the position property a bit more, I never understood absolute and relative positioning in the past and what they did. I'm also going through the reading for Arrays and Loops, still got a ways to go. I'll probably finish this by tomorrow.

### Day 25: April 10th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learn Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano on freeCodeCamp and completed reading from Arrays and Loops module on TOP.

**Thoughts**: Media queries were easier than I thought they were when I finished that little project on freeCodeCamp, I just need to add additional code when I do write them. It'll take practice but I'm sure that I will eventually get it. As for Arrays and Loops, I did all the required reading, I will do the exercises tomorrow after my morning routine.

### Day 26: April 11th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Technical Documentation Page project on freeCodeCamp and finished the first exercise of the Arrays and Loops assignment on TOP.

**Thoughts**: I'm upset that I had a single typo affecting my ability to pass the damn tests today for the project, ugh. Also, I'm going to have to take a break from TOP because I need more reading into Arrays and Loops before I go any further with the exercises and course.

### Day 27: April 12th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed first 2 exercises of the Arrays and Loops assignment and started Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: As of right now, I'm pretty stuck on The Odin Project and would need to look elsewhere for further instruction on JavaScript. I'll try taking a more in-depth course on Codecademy for JavaScript to fill in some of the knowledge gaps I'm having. In the meantime, let me focus on freeCodeCamp so I can get the Responsive Web Design certification.

### Day 28: April 13th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Variables seem simple enough, especially when it's mostly used for colors. I will focus on finishing Responsive Web Design and do the Codecademy course for JavaScript so I can resume doing The Odin Project.

### Day 29: April 14th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: CSS Grid seems a little more complex than Flexbox, I'll have to do some more reading on what grid-template-columns are. I understood what align-items, justify-content and gap elements were but I need a little more understanding.

### Day 30: April 15th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Started Product Landing Page project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**:  Built out the HTML structure of this page and most of the CSS styling. I'm struggling with the layout of the Pricing and Footer elements, I shall work on that and the media queries tomorrow.

Day 30: April 16th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished Product Landing Page project and Learn CSS Animation by Building a Ferris Wheel module on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**:  Finished out the Product Landing Page, I used the Fender guitar brand for my project. I got it to mostly work right, I do have to get some more practice on media queries though so the website looks good at any resolution. I learned some CSS Animations, which wasn't difficult at all in comparison. I'm a module and a final certification project away from getting the Responsive Web Design certification, which is exciting!

### Day 32: April 17th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin module on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**:  This project is the last one I have to do before I do my final certification project for the Responsive Web Design. I'm excited yet nervous to do the Javascript certification.

(https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-css-transforms-by-building-a-penguin/)


### Day 33: April 18th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin module on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**:  This was a little hard to finish as I felt the the module didn't teach much in terms of CSS transform properties but probably because I was rushing through it so I can do the final project. I will work on that project tomorrow.

### Day 334: April 19th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Started Learn HTML course on Codecademy, finished Introduction: Fundamentals of HTML and Learn HTML: Elements.

**Thoughts**:  Decided to pivot to using Codecademy to refresh HTML, CSS and then dig deeper into JavaScript before going back to The Odin Project.
**Link(s) to work**: 
(https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/lessons/intro-to-html)

### Day 35: April 20th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learn HTML: Structure,Learn HTML: Tables and Semantic HTML.

**Thoughts**: This was very simple for me to do, I feel like The Odin Project didn't teach much in the way of tables and Semantic HTML.
**Link(s) to work**: 
(https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/lessons/intro-to-html)

### Day 36: April 21th,2024

**Today's Progress**: Started Full-Stack Engineer Path on Codecademy..

**Thoughts**: After finishing the Learn HTML mini-course, I decided to dive into the Full-Stack Engineer Path and work my way through it. It'll help me reinforce concepts of HTML and CSS and fill in some gaps during my downtime at work.
