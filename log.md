# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 12,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML Survey Form project on FreeCode Camp and installed Git on Oracle VM VirtualBox.

**Thoughts:** I'm not very new to HTML but I struggled with understanding how to install Git and use the Bash terminal.

### Day 2: March 13,2024 

**Today's Progress**: Learn CSS Box Model and Flexbox through FreeCodeCamp projects of the "Rothko painting" and "Photo Gallery".

**Thoughts**: These are simply refreshers on CSS I've done before but taking the time to read and understand each piece of code instead of rushing has really solidified my understanding of what margin, padding and display properties are.

### Day 3: March 14,2024

**Today's Progress**: Delved deeper into using Git, getting familiar with cloning repositories and using the Bash terminal more often. Completed the HTML section for The Odin Project.

**Thoughts**: Using Bash instead of the UI to move folders and files has been good practice for me. I was already familair with HTML beforehand so I breezed through that section in Foundations.

### Day 4: March 15,2024

**Today's Progress**: Delved deeper into using Git, getting familiar with cloning repositories and using the Bash terminal more often. Completed the HTML section for The Odin Project and first 5 Foundations exercises.

**Thoughts**: The assignments were easy to do once I've read the README.md and looked at the desired results, had no trouble getting it done without the solutions.

### Day 5: March 16,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed The Cascade, learned Chrome DevTools basics and solved the final Foundations exercise.

**Thoughts**: I struggled to center an image on the original odin-recipes project I did but once I searched for a solution online, I was able to implement it with little trouble.

### Day 6: March 17,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Block and Inline module on TOP, halfway through the learn accessibility quiz project on FCC and updated odin-recipes project with cleaner navigation and button links on all individual recipe pages.

**Thoughts**: I'm having some trouble with centering objects on a page but I think using divs around content that I want to center using margin seems to be the best method. I'm also getting used to specifying selectors to make sure some properties don't conflict with what I want. Accessibiity is a big priority of mine so I'm taking my time getting through the quiz project I'm building because I want to understand it better.

### Day 7: March 18,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learn Accessibility quiz project on FCC and learned CSS Flexbox properties on TOP, read documentation on flex, justify-content and align-items.

**Thoughts**: Flexbox is quite a learning curve but I definitely understood after read MDN docs and watching Kevin Powell's YouTube video on Flexbox model. With some practice, I know I'll understand the ins and outs.

### Day 8: March 19,2024

**Today's Progress**: Read Alignments module on TOP and started Learn HTML course on Codeacademy.

**Thoughts**: Lots of reading on Flexbox, I definitely understand align-items and justify-content more with the interactive tutorials but flex shorthand properties, main-axis and cross-axis are still taking some time to sink in my brain.

### Day 10: March 20,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed flex folder in css-exercises from TOP.

**Thoughts**: Flexbox exercises were simple in the beginning  but I started to struggled with exercises 5-7, had to get some hints from the solutions folder to help me along. I'm definitely going to have to go back and re-read the documentation and take physical notes on difficult web development concepts.

### Day 11: March 21,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed flex fold in css-exercises a second time and completed all 24 levels of Flexbox Froggy.

**Thoughts**: Doing the exercises again, I had an easier time doing them once I re-read all the assigned readings and some supplemental resources on TOP. I only peeked at the solutions for 1 exercise but that's a big step for me! I also tapped into the Flexbox Froggy game to enrich my understanding of Flexbox, I'm a little more confident now to take on the Flexbox project tomorrow.

### Day 12: March 22,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Landing Page project on TOP using CSS Flexbox.

**Thoughts**: I struggled a little getting things to sit right once I started incorporating Flexbox. I had no issues visualing the desired outcome into containers and boxes, starting with only writing the HTML structure of the layout and then working from the header all the way down to the footer helped so much. I have to tackle this project (and future ones!) one container at a time and I think I will fare just fine!

### Day 13: March 23,2024

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded and deployed the Landing Page project to Github, moved on to learning Javascript basics.

**Thoughts**: I was super proud of myself for getting that project done from scratch. Now I am learning basic Javascript, which is a quite a refresher as I took a course on it on Codecademy. I remember quite a few things but not the syntax but my memory is coming back.

### Day 14: March 24,2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Variables and Operators module on TOP.

**Thoughts**: As I mentioned yesterday, I remember some of this from a course I took on Codecademy even though I never finished. I learned how to put a script inside the <body> tag element on a HTML file and how to operate the console when I open the Live Server. Most of today has been reading different documentation and doing little exercises to reinforce what I learned. Lots of potential with using Javascript to further enhance my websites now that I have HTML and CSS Flexbox in my toolkit.

### Day 15: March 25,2024

**Today's Progress**: Made my way halfway through Data Types and Conditionals on TOP.

**Thoughts**: Lots of reading to get through again, did a little experimentation along with the tutorials but not much coding involved yet. Will be doing the Replit exercises tomorrow!

### Day 16: March 26,2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Data Types and Conditionals module on TOP, finished all 4 Replit exercises.

**Thoughts**: Exercises were easy to do, the module was very reading intensive with all the Javascript resources given.

### Day 17: March 27,2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Javascript Developer Tools module on TOP.

**Thoughts**: Since I am back at work, progress on learning has been getting slower. While I did read the resources and followed along with some of the tutorials, I somehow had a hard time recreating the debugging tutorial Chrome DevTools had. Huh. I guess I'll have to go back and try again tomorrow just to make sure I didn't miss anything about it before moving forward to learn more about Javascript.
